# Sql practice project
### Project Overview 
* This started out as a practice project but then went out to do my own analysis
* The dataset in focus is of Covid-19 Pandemic.
* Thorough EDA (that will be mentioned below) was perfromed on various aspects of Covid 
* Interesting observations were exported as csv and through Tabluea, data was visualized    

### Resources 
* Start by following this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM sql tutorial but then did some analysis on my own 
* Dataset : https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths 
* Packages/languages : SQL ,Tabluea,excel 
* Tabluea visualizations : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vrashank.shetty/viz/PracticeProject_16860516895090/Dashboard1?publish=yes

### Data Cleaning 
* The Dataset was workable to begin with 
* Some unnessecary columns were dropped 

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
Following observations were derived by exploring the dataset 
* The infection percentage and the death percentage of India were calculated 
* Created a view for the infection percentage around the world and which was then visualised in tabluea

* Created a view for the highest number of new cases in a day and then used tabluea to display it
